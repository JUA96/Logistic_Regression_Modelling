# What influences voter preferences in European elections?

There are a number of factors influencing voter habits of Europeans. These factors are determined by political, economic and social variables. For instance, does membership in a trade-union influence a voters decision to vote in favour of increased European integration. Or are certain ethnic groups more inclined to vote in one way rather than another.

The logistic models programmed here attempt to illuminate the main variables in voter decision making. The preliminary results provided by the logistic regression models were used to make predictions about the way in which voters are likley to vote in future eureopean elections.
