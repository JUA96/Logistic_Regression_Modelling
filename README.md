What influences voter preferences in European elections?

There are a number of determinants in the voter habits of Europeans. These determinants are both political, economic and social. For instance, does membership in a trade-union influence a voters decision to vote in favour of increased European integration or the opposite. 

The logistic models programmed here attempt to illuminate the main variables in voter decision making. The preliminary results provided by the logistic regression models are used to make predictions about the way in which voters are likley to vote in future eureopean elections.
